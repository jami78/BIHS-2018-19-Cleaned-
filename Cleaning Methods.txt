During the data preprocessing stage, various techniques were employed to ensure the quality and suitability of the data for analysis. Categorical variables underwent comprehensive mapping to numerical
representations. Missing values were carefully addressed through deletion, ensuring data integrity without introducing undue bias. Additionally, relevant new 
columns were derived through strategic combinations of existing data, including the creation of a weighted average variable. To further prepare the data for robust regression analysis, 
all columns were standardized, mitigating the potential for skewing the results due to differing scales. Finally, datasets were expertly merged, seamlessly integrating diverse information sources and enriching the 
overall analysis. These meticulous data cleaning procedures established a solid foundation for reliable and insightful findings.
